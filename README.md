# Personal Website 
This is my personal website made with AWS Amplify.
When I started this project, I had to register my own domain with AWS Route 53. Learning AWS has been an experience to say the least. 
As for design of this website, I wanted to show my level of experience with certain languages and show off some personal projects.
