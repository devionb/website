<p>My name is Devion Buchynsky. I am currenlty a senior at Bowling Green State University (BGSU) for Computer Science.</p> <!-- comment -->
<p>This is my personal website made with AWS Amplify, AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, AWS SES and Google reCAPTCHA. 
I used another Github Respository from CodeNerve for the intial website, but I have changed a lot from the original. 
When I started this project, I had to register my own domain with AWS Route 53. 
Learning AWS has been an experience to say the least. </p>
